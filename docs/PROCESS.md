<H1> Process Documentation - Complete Tier</H1>

1. I built a button on WyleyMedia (my consultant website) that allow users to toggle between dark and light mode on the webpage.

2. Micro-interation felt weird at first instead of working with claude to do the project as whole, it forced me to work in steps. At the end of my experience I enjoyed the micro-interation, it helped me test the code a lot faster and ensure that I hadv everything working as enteded. This also helped me to take pictures of the progression of the website as I made the changes.

3. Self-reveiw caught some minor mistakes in it's own code. In claude none of the changes caught broke the website, however, it was minor things that claude thought could be done better.

4. I enjoyed working with Claude Web, some of the extentions and features that I am used to when working with in in visual studio code weren't there. The two things that I missed was claude updating the code on it's own and the extraction of the claude chat for turning in our assignments. I did enjoy the indepth feedback and how claude broke down what changes in the code so I cna know what exactly what to test in th web version.

5. The AI did not catch any major issue, the issues caught were formating and css issues. I didn't find any major issues in the code, however, the code file is over 1000 lines worth of code. It is possible that an issue or two may have been missed by both myself and AI.

6. The CLI comparison with claude code is better, because I know how to use the product better. I believe that the more time I spend Claude web the more I feel like my answer could change. Overall, I do believe after one week I still would like to use my CLI.

7. I would use micro-interation and self-review for the projects that requires a lot of focus. Projects that have lots of code, including those that I code with and without the help of AI. This process can help with my capstone project or any future assignments in this class.
